# Assessment Test

## Real Time Chat Application using Firebase. 

## Instructions were provided as follows:

### To better assess your skills please complete the following within 1 week. 

### Create a real time chat application using firebase real time database and firebase hosting. Firebase is free to use for this. It should be for at least 2 persons. I would prefer if you used riotjs, but vanilla javascript will be accepted. No jquery, bootstrap, or other helper libraries/frameworks, I would like to see how well you know javascript, css and html without libraries. 

### I will be looking for how you structure your app and your code, what features you include(like authentication), and how the UI/UX feels and looks. Do your best as this will be the main assessment of your skills. 

### Do not copy and paste a tutorial of how to do this, or a large portion of your code, I will know if you do this and your work will not be accepted. Although I expect you to look through some tutorials as this assignment assess your ability to learn and problem solve. 

### Use github/bitbucket to share the code with me once you have completed it, along with the link to the hosted application on firebase.
